        We create the perfect trip, designed just for you by understanding your
        likes and dislikes. We take time with each of our special clients to
        understand the dream that they have and do everything in our power to
        exceed their expectations. We receive many requests for travel
        assistance but only work with a few clients at a time, in order to
        provide our best service. Below is a general timeline and an outline of
        what to expect when working with one of our agents.
      </p>
      <p className="howWeWorkPoint">
        1. Email: Please email info@travelsalesgroup.com (or click the contact
        us button to fill out the form) and provide us with the basics of your
        trip specifications (dates, destination, occasion, number of travel,
        origination airport, etc.)
      </p>
      <p className="howWeWorkPoint">
        2. TSG planning fee: Upon receiving and reviewing your request, we will
        respond quickly (within 24 business hours or less—usually within a few
        hours) and let you know if we feel we can make your vacation dream a
        reality. At this point, a non-refundable Planning fee is requested as
        follows:
      </p>
      <p className="howWeWorkPoint">
        Individual/Couple Package style vacation (All inclusive, single
        destination etc): A nonrefundable $100 per person fee via personal check
        or credit card is required. As long as a trip is booked within 3 months
        of that start date (with destination weddings, honeymoons and large
        groups, this timeline can be negotiated), that is the only fee that we
        will ever charge. It generally does not end up costing you any more to
        book and take a trip with one of our expert agents. You will almost
        always save that much on the cost of your trip. In rare case, you will
        not save a ton but will not spend more either. ALWAYS, your experience
        will be better and the VALUE of your trip will be better. This fee just
        allows us to focus our time on the clients who are really ready to plan
        and book a trip with us.
      </p>
      <p className="howWeWorkPoint">
        Custom catered Itinerary: If trip planning involves multiple
        destinations or a complicated itinerary, we require a non-refundable
        planning fee of $200 per person to cover our time and expenses, as
        itineraries like this are very time intensive. Charging this fee up
        front allows us to get back to our serious clients in a timely manner.
      </p>
      <p className="howWeWorkPoint">
        Groups: For groups of 10 or more, the non refundable planning fee and
        the length of time needed to book will be quoted based on the situation,
        size of the group, and occasion.
      </p>
      <p className="howWeWorkPoint">
        Air Only: Most of our resort packages to places like Mexico and the
        Caribbean will already include flights in the package with no fee. Since
        airlines do not pay commission, we do charge a service fee for air only
        bookings. We will be happy to make recommendations for you to look on
        your own free of charge. Should you wish to save the time, we will
        happily book those flights for a small convenience fee:
      </p>
      <p className="howWeWorkPoint">
        $50 per person / per flight for domestic flights
      </p>
      <p className="howWeWorkPoint">
        $100 per person / per flight for international flights
      </p>
      <p className="howWeWorkPointSubHead">
        If we don't think we can custom create the perfect experience for you
        and your loved ones, we will gladly refer you to a trusted colleague who
        is an expert in that area of travel.
      </p>
      <p className="howWeWorkPointSubHead">The Timeline:</p>
      <p className="howWeWorkPoint">
        Once you have selected your agent and have sent in your request and PTB
        deposit, you will receive our Vacation Questionaire. This can also be
        discussed over the phone with your agent. With this, we ask a few
        general questions, in order to customize your vacation to fit your very
        specific needs and desires. We are not a “drive thru agency” that shoves
        certain resorts down your throat and offers a menu to choose from. Think
        of us as your vacation concierge. We do not want to book one trip with
        you. We want to be your agent for ALL of them going forward so we are
        going to do everything we can to make this perfect for YOU! Our job is
        to listen to your requests and preferences and turn them into the dream
        that you have envisioned for this trip! Tweaking the details is a very
        important part of the process! When all is said and done, the more we
        know, the better your experience will be. So do not skimp on the
        details!
      </p>
      <p className="howWeWorkPoint">
        Our experts can help you weed through the sea of information you found
        on the internet before you contacted us (Yes, we know everyone does that
        and that is really ok!). Now, you are working with experts with decades
        of travel experience all over the world! Our sole purpose is to help you
        craft the dream honeymoon, anniversary trip, family getaway, milestone
        celebration or any other adventure you can pull out of that brain of
        yours!

        4. Documents: You will receive your final documents within 1-2 weeks of
        travel, if not sooner. Depending on the type of vacation we have created
        for you, your documents may be either electronic or paper documents with
        vouchers. You will need to keep a copy of these documents with you while
        traveling as proof of your purchase. If you prefer one type of document,
        please let your agent know.

      <p className="howWeWorkPoint">

        put together for then come home and let us know all about it. Of course,
        if you are posting to your social media pages, please feel free to tag
        us and use the hashtag #travelsalesgroupies !! We love referrals and
        reviews that mention us on tripadvisor and facebook as well!
      </p>
      <p className="howWeWorkPoint">
        Travel Insurance: We highly recommend purchasing travel insurance. On
        occasion, unexpected events or accidents can leave you with cancelled
        plans and significant expenses. Travel Insurance can help cover you,
        your belongings, and your travel investment against unwelcome surprises.
        We will be able to provide you with a custom quote with every trip
        booked.
